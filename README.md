# vs-ext-deepseek-chat README

Feel free to use and alter this extension "vs-ext-deepseek-chat" for your own needs.

## Features

This is a Visual Code Extension implementing the basic logic to forward user prompts and display an answer from Ollama's deepseek in a response window.

To run a VS Code editor with the loaded extension use CTRL+Shift+P then select "Select and Start Debugging". Then press Enter when the selected "Debug Extension" shows up, otherwise select it.

VS Code will then open with 'vs-ext-deepseek-chat' enabled. Now press CTRL+Shift+P (in that debugging code editor ) again and type "Chat with DeepSeek".

A new panel should show up and you are good to go.

## Requirements

Select and install an ollama model on your computer:

For the extension you need to install ollama (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ollama):

npm install ollama
